1. What are you trying to do?
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To propose bike and hiking trails in a certain area, based on the user
preferences (length, difficulty, point of interest). Collect all the knowledge
possible about trails and propose a great mix.
To export these trails in GPS.

2. How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today : google maps, useful to go quickly from A to B but not to take a nice
path in the wood. You need to go by yourself to find a good path or to talk with
other bikers (there are websites for that).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bikers, hikers or anybody who wants to plan a trip.

5. If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make?  How do you
measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, groundtruth data, etc.)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to generate interesting paths.
We can delete a good path from the dataset and try to recreate it.
Feedback from users.

6. What are the risks and payoffs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It could be a boring or dangerous trail.

7. How much will it cost?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A server.

8. How long will it take?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole semester.

9. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fist steps:
- grab enough information
- design algorithm
