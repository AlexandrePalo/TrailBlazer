# Front end application

## Installation

### Preleminaries

Be sure to have NodeJs and yarn installed (or npm). In this tutorial, we assume
that you have `yarn` installed. If this is not the case and you prefer to use
`npm`, just replace every `yarn` command by `npm`.

### Packages installation

#### Go to the folder of the project, and the frontEnd subfolder:

* `cd PATH_TO_FOLDER_DOWNLOADED_UNZIPPED/frontEnd`

#### Install serve package

* `yarn global add serve` (or `npm install -g serve`). If needed, run this
  command with administrator privileges or sudo.
